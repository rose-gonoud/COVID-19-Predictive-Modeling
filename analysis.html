                  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Linear regressions (standard
                  entry) were conducted on the percent of confirmed cases of the
                  novel coronavirus and the percent of deaths attributed to the
                  novel coronavirus reported 30 days post state lockdown order
                  using variables taken from the 2018 Social Vulnerability Index
                  (SVI; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2018). The
                  percentages were calculated using 2014-2018 county-level
                  population data taken from the SVI. Both the SVI variables and
                  the coronavirus data were indexed at the county level.
                  <br />

                  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; SVI variables that were used as predictors included county
                  area in square miles, housing unit estimate, households
                  estimate, persons below poverty estimate, civilian (age 16+)
                  unemployed estimate, per capita income estimate, persons (age
                  25+) with no high school diploma estimate, persons aged 65 and
                  older estimate, persons aged 17 and younger estimate, civilian
                  noninstitutionalized population with a disability estimate,
                  single parent household with children under 18 estimate,
                  minority (all persons except white, non-Hispanic) estimate,
                  persons (age 5+) who speak English “less than well” estimate,
                  housing in structures with 10 or more units estimate, mobile
                  homes estimate, at household level (occupied housing units),
                  more people than rooms estimate, households with no vehicles
                  available estimate, and persons in institutionalized group
                  quarters estimate.

                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A standard entry regression was
                    conducted on the percent of confirmed coronavirus cases.

                    F(18, 2,499) = 1019.356, p < 0.001. Five variables failed to
                    significantly contribute to the model, including county area
                    in square miles, housing unit estimate, civilian
                    noninstitutionalized population with a disability estimate,
                    persons (age 5+) who speak English “less than well”

                    omitted here; note that sr<sup>2</sup>unique refers to the squared
                    proportion of variance uniquely explained by each predictor
                    variable) included households estimate (sr<sup>2</sup>unique = .009),

                    17 and younger estimate (sr<sup>2</sup>unique = .044), single parent
                    household with children under 18 estimate (sr<sup>2</sup>unique =
                    .0003), minority (all persons except white, non-Hispanic)
                    estimate (sr<sup>2</sup>unique = .010), housing in structures with 10
                    or more units estimate (sr<sup>2</sup>unique = .001), at household
                    level (occupied housing units), more people than rooms
                    estimate (sr<sup>2</sup>unique = .001), households with no vehicles
                    available estimate (sr<sup>2</sup>unique = .119), and persons in
                    institutionalized group quarters estimate (sr<sup>2</sup>unique =
